This is a Cinnamon applet, which lets you access your places and bookmarks through an icon in the cinnamon panel, as well as launch a terminal in those locations.

Left-clicking the item will open the corresponding folder for that item.
Right-clicking the item will launch gnome-terminal starting in that item's location.

Installation
================
	
	1) Copy the folder "places-with-terminal@mtwebster" to "~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/".
	
	2) Enable the applet in cinnamon settings.




This is a heavily modified version of the applet 'places-bookmarks@dmo60.de' - I've merely added the ability to launch a terminal.
